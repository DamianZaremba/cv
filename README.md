# Damian Zaremba

\Begin{multicols}{2}

![](damian.jpeg){width=300px}

I am an experienced professional with a background in IT systems/network engineering & PADI/TecRec/EFR training.

Previously I have been a climbing instructor for the scout association, maintainer of anti-vandalism services for Wikipedia, a volunteer at conferences & a business owner.

In addition, I have worked on infrastructure for organisations ranging from lean start-ups to multi-billion dollar public companies.

My curious nature & desire for knowledge results in ongoing learning & advancement of existing ratings, incrementally improving my valuable skillset.

I am currently looking for a PADI 5-star centre with IDC/TecRec accreditation that can support taking my professional diving to the next level.

# Diving experience

Over the last four years, I have logged more than 500 dives across multiple countries
ranging from beautiful tropical & sub-tropical destinations including Thailand, Mexico, Egypt & Tenerife,
to the cooler northern climates, including Iceland, Germany & the Netherlands.

The wide range of diving locations & opportunities has enabled me to advance
my skills & knowledge, achieving many certifications along the way
including TecRec & professional ratings.

After assisting with more than 150 students & personally instructing more than 200,
one of the best rewards is watching others grow, achieve new things & have their own experiences.

With northern Europe offering cold water diving all year,
I have significant experience with diving & managing students in challenging conditions,
including dark/turbid waters & extensive dry-suit diving.
