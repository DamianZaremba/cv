<p>On a daily basis I was working with solutions ranging from bespoke shared hosting platforms to multi site geo-graphically redundant solutions featuring file and database replication.</p>
<p>The work ranged from installing and upgrading software to performing disaster recovery and investigating and resolving faults with applications. This could range from troubleshooting a segfaulting binary to recovering a down server.</p>
<p>I also had to deal with out of hours network and power issues on a datacenter wide scale and during periods of my rota I was solely responsible for resolving alerts as they were triggered and maintaining SLA levels.</p>
