\subsubsection{TravelJigsaw Limited (Rentalcars.com) - Technical
Architect}\label{traveljigsaw-limited-rentalcars.com---technical-architect}}

\emph{June 2015 - November 2015}

As a founding member of the architecture team, my initial focus was a
review of the core systems, potential contention/failure points and a
roadmap for core infrastructure.

The work was varied and included documenting existing systems,
interviewing candidates for multiple roles, providing expert support
during service issues/solution design, building software prototypes,
working with the teams to establish standards and designing new
solutions.

As the only infrastructure-focused member of the team, a lot of
alignment and collaboration with the 2 software architects was
undertaken during this time.

Some key solutions that were designed and placed into production
included:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Internet connectivity, resolving redundancy issues and providing
  future scalability; this established the first ASN and IP space
  directly held by the company
\item
  AWS direct connect for hybrid (test/development) environments; a
  successful PoC, now supporting multiple teams and production services
\item
  `Event backbone' using Apache Flume and Kafka with custom consumers
  written in Java; a successful PoC handling millions of events a
  minute. This is now the standard way to transmit/consume events within
  the company and has a diverse set of backends (ElasticSearch, MySQL,
  AppDynamics, HDFS etc)
\end{itemize}

Other outcomes included:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  An 18-month roadmap/improvement plan for the network
\item
  Numerous risks identified within the technology landscape and
  prioritised for resolution with the engineering teams
\item
  Implementation of Bamboo for CI, including multiple example jobs and
  Java-based plugins
\item
  Implementation of Artifactory Pro for internal binary sharing
  (integrated into Bamboo and internal deployment systems)
\item
  Updated design for a multistage Clos architecture within the data
  centres, with the budget accepted
\end{itemize}
