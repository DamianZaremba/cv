review of the core systems, potential contention/failure points and a
roadmap for core infrastructure.

The work was varied and included documenting existing systems,
interviewing candidates for multiple roles, providing expert support
during service issues/solution design, building software prototypes,
working with the teams to establish standards and designing new
solutions.

As the only infrastructure focused member of the team, a lot of
alignment and collaboration with the 2 software architects was
undertaken during this time.

Some key solutions that were designed and placed into production
included:

  Internet connectivity, resolving redundancy issues and providing
  future scalability; this established the first ASN and IP space
  directly held by the company
\item
  AWS direct connect for hybrid (test/development) environments; a
  successful PoC, now supporting multiple teams and production services
\item
  `Event backbone' using Apache Flume and Kafka with custom consumers
  written in Java; a successful PoC handling millions of events a
  minute. This is now the standard way to transmit/consume events within
  the company and has a diverse set of backends (ElasticSearch, MySQL,
  AppDynamics, HDFS etc)
\end{itemize}

Other outcomes included:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
